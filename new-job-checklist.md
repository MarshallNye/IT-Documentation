# OVERVIEW
This document is designed to give a Sysadmin starting a new job a list of things to check for.

# Backups
After getting your workstation, admin credentials and HR paperwork, this should literally be the first thing you look into. 
* Are there backups? 
* Is someone actively monitoring and maintaining them? 
* ARE THEY TESTED?
* Do they follow a 3-2-1 model?
* Is there a recovery location?
* When was the last time something needed to be restored?
* What is physically storing the backups? Are there any issues? Is the storage appliance still supported by the vendor?

# Documentation
* Is there any documentation?
* If one does not exist, create a documentation wiki. Define this as the "one source of truth"
* Begin the process of transforming existing documentation to the new format
* Consider if your new system supports change management logging. 

# Security
* Is there a security team? Who is it?
* Are credentials shared? Is everyone using one domain admin for literally everything?
* Is your daily driver account an admin, is IT using local admin accounts?
* Is everyone in the organization running local admin?
* IS THERE A FIREWALL?

# Change Management
* Is there a change management system in place?
* This should be as automated as possible.

# Crisis Planning
* Is there a DRP/BCP in place? Is it up to date? Is it practiced?
* Is there a go-bag/oh-shit-kit somewhere with supplies and the DRP?

# Monitoring

# Desired State Configuration
