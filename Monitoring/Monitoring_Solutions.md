# Overview
Before you choose a monitoring solution, you need to know what you are trying to monitor. You may need to implement multiple solutions; don't get hung up on "Single Pane of Glass". 

# Open Source vs Paid
None of this is 'free'. You will either pay licensing fees, or labor to build your own. Remember that your labor is actually very expensive to the organization, and yourself. Hours spent building a monitoring platform are hours not spent somewhere else. There is a balance to be struck, and that is different for every organization. I HIGHLY recommend you buy and read Practical Monitoring by Mike Julian.

Most of the open source solutions are linux based, so it would give a Windows Admin the opportunity to dip their toes into Linux.
