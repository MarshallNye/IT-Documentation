FERPA Regulations Summary
FERPA (Family Education Rights and Privacy Act) is a federal law which the Congress passed back in 1974 to protect educational information and records.

FERPA Compliance Checklist
you need to grant students access to their own records

you need to ask for students’ permission before disclosing their records, even to their parents

you need to make education records ready for review within 45 days of the request

you mustn’t destroy an education record if someone has filed a request to view that education record

you need to grant parents/guardians to view records of their child, but you can’t disclose any part of that student’s records that refers to another student

you are obliged to provide meaningful assistance to a student/parents who can’t understand English well

while you’re generally not required to provide a copy of student records to a parent/student, eg in case they live outside the commuting distance of the school and can’t otherwise view the records, you do need to make it possible for them to see the records, which might include preparing a copy of the documents

in case a student/parent makes a request to change parts of their records, you need to address that request; however you’re not obliged to grant it

you shouldn’t disclose student records to a third party unless that third party has a written consent by the student/their parents

Why is FERPA important?
FERPA is important because it protects the privacy of education information and records. In a nutshell, FERPA guards the safety of students’ personal information, and governs access to these information by third parties. FERPA gives the right to parents and students older than 18 to inspect and review their personal records, which helps maintain accuracy and protect the privacy and integrity of students.

# What information is protected by FERPA?
FERPA protects personal information of students, including their contact information, data on academic achievements, health information and more.

# What is an education record under FERPA?
Under FERPA, education records include information which public, private, and parochial schools have on their former and current students.

These records include data such as:

* a student’s name and contact information
* a parent’s name and contact information
* grades and test results
* discipline reports
* health records
* courses attended and information of attendance
* awards and degrees earned

# When do FERPA rights begin?
Students can exercise their FERPA rights once they turn 18 or enter a postsecondary institution (regardless of age). Once this happens, you can disclose a student’s records to their parents only with prior consent from the student.

# Who is eligible to look at a student’s records?
A student older than 18, as well as parents/foster parents/legal guardians of a student can look at the student’s records.
However, no student or parent can request to look at the records or parts of records that include personal information of another student.

# What information can schools release without consent?
As a school/higher education institution, you have the right to release information without a student’s consent, if you receive a request from a State education office or when you need to follow a court order.

# What happens if a school violates FERPA?
In case you or your school/college violates FERPA requirements, by, for example, disclosing a student’s records without proper consent, you can lose funding and be fined. This depends on the extent of the violation.

Under a 2002 Supreme Court decision, parents or students can file a lawsuit against you only in line with a state law, not federal law.

Hence, it’s best you consider the consequences of FERPA violation by consulting the relevant laws of your state or with your solicitor.

Of course, acting as an institution, you have the right to ask for the employees who have violated FERPA requirements to be removed from their jobs.

# FERPA Violation Examples
As a general rule, the key FERPA principle is protecting information that can help identify a person. Here are some instances could be technically understood to mean that you have violated FERPA rules:

* you place your monitor in such a location that people can see it through a window or a doorway
* a teacher puts up the test scores on the bulletin board or asks one student to distribute graded papers
* you use an educational software for which your school doesn’t have the contract with the vendor
* the vendor you chose mishandles students’ information – your school still holds accountability for improper data management
* a teacher uses social networks to connect students with classroom pages, without parents’ consent
* a teacher leaves their grade book open so that one student can see the grades of other students
* you opt for a vendor that relies on data mining to provide its services to you
